                            <p>Our company was established in 2015 as a company that<br class="c-pc">revolutionizes business communication platforms.</p>
                            <p>Communication tools have changed significantly as the times have changed.<br class="c-pc">The telephone, which was invented in the 1870s, and the commercialization of<br class="c-pc">the internet in the 1990s, dramatically
                                evolved our communication style.</p>
                            <p>Now a new revolution is happening in communication with AI.</p>
                            <p>It is not difficult to imagine that the 5G networks<br class="c-pc">that are yet to come will further change our communication style.</p>
                            <p>I, as a woman and a mother, have always contemplated what<br class="c-pc">needs to be done in order to achieve a healthy balance between<br class="c-pc">work and child raising while traveling for business domestically and overseas.</p>
                            <p>With our realization that communication is the key to corporate activities and<br class="c-pc">that more active communication may help our clients improve their productivity,<br class="c-pc">we operate AI CROSS.</p>
                            <p>In Japan, to promote work style reform,<br class="c-pc">a further improvement in productivity is expected.<br class="c-pc">The decline of the working population is<br class="c-pc">becoming an issue not only in Japan, but across
                                the world.</p>
                            <p>We believe it is our mission to constantly seek new communication styles<br class="c-pc">and solve issues to contribute to<br class="c-pc">our clients’ business development.</p>
                            <p>We will continue to work for further revolutions by<br class="c-pc">flexibly adapting to changing times and utilizing AI technology as<br class="c-pc">a new communication platform.</p>
